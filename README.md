# Goal of the study

1. We want to show that acoustic indices correlate with hill number (an ecologically more meaningful number as species are weighted by their calls)

hill number ~ acoustic indices + ordinal day + NDVI

2. We can use acoustic indices to track phenology

Show how acoustic indices vary at the different sites. For instance, in spring we should see acoustic indices high in the south of NOrway and we should see an increase in AI values in the northern sites.

Acoustic Indices vs number of days over certain temperature / over day length days (more sun)
